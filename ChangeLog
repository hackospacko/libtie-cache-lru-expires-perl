        CLEAR function, to clear the hash.

0.53 -- Documentation change. Email address has changed, last name has
	changed.

0.52 -- On advise of Michael G Schwern, I've changed the tie interface
        to Tie::Cache::LRU used in Tie::Cache::LRU::Expires in an object 
        interface (seems to be twice as fast).

0.51 -- Because of a detected memory leak in v0.20 of Tie::Cache::LRU, i've
        had to make this module dependend on v0.21 of Tie::Cache::LRU.

0.50 -- Initial version
